# Muqsit Health System — Functional Audit & TODO

Audit of what works, what doesn't persist, and what's a stub. Updated as items are fixed.

## 0. Operational
- [ ] **Restart API server** — stop it, run `npx prisma generate` in `server/`, then `npm run dev`.
      New columns (`hmSelectedDrugs`, `familyMembers`, `favouriteInvestigations`, `IpdAdmission.clinical`)
      are live in Postgres but the running NestJS process still uses the old Prisma client.
      All saves silently succeed in Postgres but new columns won't be read back until after restart.

## 1. Not persisted (in-memory only — "save & reload = gone")
- [x] **Family tree** (`familyMembers`) — now saved to `Patient.familyMembers` (JSONB). Loaded on patient open.
- [x] **Health-monitoring drug selections** (`hmDrugs`) — now saved to `Patient.hmSelectedDrugs` (TEXT[]). Loaded on patient open.
- [ ] **Supervising doctor list** — hardcoded mock; add/edit/delete not wired.
- [ ] **Investigation / report images** (base64 `invImages` pool) — findings *text* persists; uploaded **images**
      are session-only. (Bigger fix: upload to the VPS `/uploads`, store URLs.)
- [ ] **On-examination vitals** (OE popup, `OeData`) — folded into investigation text, not stored structured.

## 2. Stub buttons / placeholder views
- [ ] **Message** tab — placeholder, no messaging.
- [ ] **Research companion → Compare / Export** — no click handlers.
- [x] **Health monitoring → "Export Patient's Data"** card — was decorative; **removed** (2026-07) rather than left as a button that does nothing on a clinical screen.
- [ ] **Patient Settings → Data security level** — disabled placeholder.
- [x] **Settings → Badges / Supervisors & role models** — intentionally disabled ("Coming soon").

## 3. By design (not a bug)
- ~~Prescription draft saves only on **Save & print**~~ — **now auto-saved server-side.** The whole editor
  (header + clinical sections + investigation findings + medicines + advice) is debounced-saved to
  `PrescriptionDraft` (one row per doctor) and re-hydrated on reload, so a refresh no longer loses work.
  Save & print still creates the permanent prescription record.
- Investigation findings added via the popup now log to the activity feed (Notification section) on every
  add path — including closing the popup, not just the per-test "Add" button.

## Fix order (this pass)
1. Health-monitoring drug selections — persist on the patient.
2. Family tree — persist on the patient.
3. Supervising doctor list — real add/edit/delete on the patient.
4. Research Export — client-side CSV.
5. Investigation/report image persistence (VPS upload) — larger, separate.

## Open threads — decisions owed, not bugs (2026-07-27)

These came out of the health-trend-chart work and its review. Each one is a
**product decision**, deliberately not taken unilaterally. Read the linked
CLAUDE.md section before picking one up.

- [ ] **Unowned patients are retained but unreachable.** Deleting a doctor no
  longer deletes their patients (`Patient.doctorId` → `SetNull`), which is the
  owner's stated model: a patient is not the property of the account that
  registered them. But `accessibleWhere()` matches owner-or-supervisor, so a
  patient with `doctorId = null` cannot be found by the next doctor's mobile
  lookup. The owner described the intended path as "mobile number **and security
  access**" — what that second half means is the open question. Widening the
  lookup to unowned patients exposes PII across practices, so it needs its own
  design: does an unowned patient appear to every doctor or must they be claimed;
  does claiming expose the prior history or only new visits; is patient consent
  (OTP?) required. See `server/CLAUDE.md` → Rule 2.
- [ ] **RPI maturation bands** (`lib/calculators/corrected-reticulocyte.ts`) are
  set to the standard published table (36-45 → 1.0, 26-35 → 1.5, 16-25 → 2.0,
  ≤15 → 2.5) after two earlier versions disagreed with it. The table is written
  into the comment. If the practice follows a different source, change it there
  and say which — do not re-band from memory.
- [ ] **The "🩺 Symptoms · all visits" panel** on the idsp tab now duplicates the
  chart's own "Symptoms shown" column exactly — same source, same list. Removing
  it is a taste call, so it was left. (The "🧪 Lab tests" panel beside it is not
  redundant: it lists *advised* tests, which the chart never plots.)
- [ ] **`manual-opd-token-unique.sql` and `manual-ipd-bed-unique.sql` are
  committed but NOT applied** to the shared database. The service-layer
  transactional checks make them optional, not redundant — apply them through
  the tunnel when convenient.
- [ ] **Test data left on a real record:** patient *muhammad jubayer*
  (`01753710293`) carries two invented drug-history entries — `Losartan 50mg`
  (10/01/2024 and 27/06/2026) and `Metformin 500mg` (20/07/2026) — added with the
  owner's permission to exercise the medication editor. Duration overrides on
  that patient were all cleared. Remove the two drugs from Drug history when they
  are no longer wanted.
